- First I am creating an app with cteate react app. I am creating some components. 
- Setting the router in the App.js file. Creating a header, setting some links in the header. Home page Carousel + Services section + Footer.
- If the user is logged in then he can go to the service details and if he is not logged in then he will be taken to the login page.
- If the user has not signed up then there is a link to sign up with email, password or sign in with Google. After signing up, an email verificaction message will be sent to the user's email, then the uset will have to verify his email. If the user forgers hos password, He will be able to reset the password. 
- Users can go to home, services, blogs page without logging in.
